XMS Control Center displays the current setup
of your eXtended Memory Manager (XMM) and
allows you to change the layout of extended
memory by modifying the currently allocated
Extended Memory Blocks (EMBs). XMS Control
Center is able to display information about
each extended block currently allocated and
allows you to free, lock, unlock or
reallocate it. You can also allocate new
extended memory blocks. Works in both
interactive and command-line mode. Created by
Aurelitec in 1997.
