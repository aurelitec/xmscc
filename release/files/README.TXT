  1. INTRODUCTION

  Extended memory is RAM above the 1-Megabyte boundary, and is available only
  on machines that have a 286 or greater CPU. In order for most applications
  to be able to use extended memory, an XMS driver must be installed to
  manage it. The most popular XMS driver is HIMEM.SYS from Microsoft.

  A DOS application can access extended memory even when running in a DOS
  shell under Windows 3.x or under Windows 95.

  XMS Control Center displays the current setup of your eXtended Memory
  Manager (XMM) and allows you to change the layout of extended memory by
  modifying the currently allocated Extended Memory Blocks (EMBs).

  When a program allocates a block of extended memory it receives a handle
  to that block and the handle is used in all operations with the block.
  XMS Control Center is able to display information about each block
  currently allocated: its handle, size, linear address and lock count.
  More important, XMS Control Center allows you to free, lock, unlock and
  reallocate any allocated extended memory block or to allocate a new one.


  2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  In order to run XMS Control Center you will need a 286 or later CPU with
  extended memory and an XMS driver that implements the Extended Memory
  Specification version 2.0 or above installed in your system.


  3. USING XMS CONTROL CENTER


  INTERACTIVE MODE

  XMS Control Center enters interactive mode if you call it without any
  parameter in the command-line or only with the /XMS or /DV switches.

  The /DV switch forces XMSCC to use direct video RAM output in interactive
  mode. By default XMSCC uses video ROM calls that will work on any IBM
  BIOS-compatible system. Direct video output is faster but your system's
  video hardware must be identical to IBM display adapters.

  See HIMEM.SYS v XMS CALLS for information about the /XMS switch.

  The XMS Control Center interactive interface was designed to be as
  self-explanatory as possible. On the main screen there are two opened
  windows: one that contains the list of the currently allocated extended
  memory blocks (EMBs) and one that displays information about the XMS driver
  and extended memory statistics. The status line located at the bottom of
  the EMBs window lists the function key commands.

  F2 Free       - Frees the highlighted EMB from the EMB list box.
  F3 Lock       - Locks the highlighted EMB from the EMB list box.
  F4 Unlock     - Unlocks the highlighted EMB from the EMB list box.
  F5 Reallocate - Reallocates the highlighted EMB from the EMB list box.
  F6 Allocate new block - Allocates a new EMB.

  Press F10 to end the program.


  THE CONFIGURATION FILE (XMSCC.INI)

  When XMS Control Center starts in interactive-mode it looks for XMSCC.INI
  in the current directory and then in the directory where XMSCC.EXE resides.
  XMS Control Center reads the contents of the configuration file and then
  configures itself accordingly. You can make XMS Control Center to ignore
  the .INI file by using the /NOCFG command-line parameter. You can also
  make XMS Control Center not to report any error found in the .INI file by
  using the /I command-line parameter. XMS Control Center reports a
  configuration error only when a key contains invalid values. It does not
  report missing configuration keys.

  The XMSCC.INI file is a text file and can be edited with any text editor.
  XMS Control Center does not modify or create it. It only reads the
  configuration from it. So you are advised not to remove any configuration
  keys from the file. It is best to keep a copy of the original .INI file.

  For more information on configuring XMS Control Center see the comments
  from XMSCC.INI.


  COMMAND-LINE MODE

  Use XMSCC/? for help.

  To print an XMS summary to the standard output call XMS Control Center with
  the following syntax: XMSCC /P [/XMS]. The summary is made up of information
  about the XMS driver and extended memory statistics and the list of all
  currently allocated extended memory blocks. You can redirect the output to a
  file or printer. (See HIMEM.SYS v XMS CALLS for information about the /XMS
  switch)

  To modify the currently allocated extended memory blocks use the following
  syntax:

  XMSCC [/F<handle>] [/L<handle>] [/U<handle>] [/R<handle>,<Ksize>] [/A<Ksize>]

  /F<handle>          Free the extended memory block (EMB) addressed by handle.
  /L<handle>          Lock the EMB addressed by handle.
  /U<handle>          Unlock the EMB addressed by handle.
  /R<handle>,<Ksize>  Reallocate the EMB addressed by handle. Ksize is the new
                      size of the block in K-bytes.
  /A<Ksize>           Allocate a new EMB of Ksize K-bytes.

  You can do more than one change with only one command-line.

  Example:

  XMSCC /F43202 /R43212,77 /L43242 /A0

  This will free the EMB addressed by handle 43202, reallocate the EMB
  addressed by handle 43212 to 77 K-bytes, lock the EMB addressed by handle
  43242 and allocate a new EMB of 0 K-bytes (use this to reserve a handle).


  4. HIMEM.SYS v XMS CALLS

  By default, if HIMEM.SYS version 3.09 or above is detected XMS Control
  Center will retrieve information about extended memory blocks directly from
  HIMEM.SYS. When using HIMEM.SYS XMS Control Center will list not only the
  currently allocated extended memory blocks but also the free ones (the ones
  that are currently not used). As HIMEM.SYS is an XMS driver that has a
  fixed number of extended memory handles, the free handles in the system
  will also be displayed.

  If a previous version of HIMEM.SYS or other XMS driver is detected the
  information will be retrieved using XMS calls. This method is slower and
  will list only the currently allocated extended memory blocks.

  Use the /XMS switch to force XMS Control Center to use the second method
  (XMS calls) even if HIMEM.SYS version 3.09 or above is detected.

  Note: HIMEM.SYS version 3.09 is a part of MS-DOS 6.00.


  5. MODIFYING EXTENDED MEMORY BLOCKS

  Modifying extended memory blocks used by other applications is generally
  NOT a very good idea. Modifying (freeing, reallocating) the wrong block may
  lead the system into an unstable state and may even damage files on your
  disk! Remember, many disk cache utilities use extended memory. Other
  programs could do a lot of damage as well if you mess with their allocated
  blocks.

  The main purpose of the free function of XMS Control Center is to help you
  free EMBs that were not freed by their owner program when it ended
  (programs that crashed and did not clean after themselves or programs that
  you are developing).

  Also use the reallocation function with care. If you reallocate an extended
  memory block to a smaller size than the old block's size, all data at the
  upper end of the old block WILL BE LOST.

  With XMS drivers that have a fixed number of extended memory handles (like
  HIMEM.SYS) you can reserve a handle by allocating a block of 0 K-bytes.


  6. TECHNICAL INFORMATION


  EXIT CODES

  XMS Control Center will return the following result codes after execution:

  0. Normal

  1. No XMS driver was found

  2. A VDISK device was detected. VDISK devices are incompatible with XMS
     drivers.

  3. Out of memory (if the information about extended memory blocks is
     larger than the available memory - a very extreme case, unlikely to
     appear)


  XMS Control Center was written using the XMS Interface for Borland C/C++
  and Borland Pascal (XMSBCP) Version 1.1 (freeware) developed by Devliber.
  This library is available by anonymous ftp from Simtel and its mirrors 
  (msdos/pgmutl/xmsbcp11.zip).

  XMS Control Center has been tested under MS-DOS 5.0, 6.00, 6.2, 6.22,
  Microsoft Windows 3.1, Microsoft Windows 95 with HIMEM.SYS.
